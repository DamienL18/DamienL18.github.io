<h3 style="text-align:center; color:yellow;">Overall the android app project was a very fun and interactive, hands on experience. The app my partner and I created was a soundboard with pop up pictures.One of the problems we encountered was uploading a video in order to use it for the sounds. We had tried numerous amounts of  different code blocks in order to get the video to play, which in the end we discovered just using call sound play would play as well, which was strenuous to go throughout the blocks and implement for the other sound files and connected onto buttons. Another difficulty that was encountered was the notifier. To fix the notifier we had to add a clock with a second interval which we had to look back at past projects to learn about the clock and how we used it which could be found in the about page. One thing I did by myself was figure out how to put pictures on the bottom when we click a button on the actual soundboard page aka screen 2 and by using a canvas and sprite.

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:yellow;">Written Response:
Overall the python project was interesting to work with a game conceived of just words. The program my partner and I created was a story game that was about an aspiring rapper.One of the problems we encountered was the indents and how to use them. We came to the solution when we figured the indents were the problem by using the internet and looking back at past work that worked till the point of issue. Another problem that had to be fixed was the answers and how to code it with the players answer. To fix this all I did was put the collons on the ends of the answer which I was confused about yet fixed by examining the example. I did the whole python code by myself yet with the help of my partner because we both did our own code yet the same project.
